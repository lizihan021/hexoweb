### **1. What I Have Done**
#### **1.1 My Projects:** 
##### **Multi-Function Tank Project**

This project is the most complex one I have finished during my intern. The tank can be controlled by both Bluetooth and IR Remote Controller. Video:

It is capable of automatically tracing faces and pointing its gun at the direction of the face. I corporated with Yu Zheqing to acomplish this challenging task. The report of the tank is posted on this link:

I also added a slingshot on the tank so it can really shoot something out. Video:

##### **Plug-in Endurance Testing Machine**

This machine can plug the USB plug in and out to test how many times the USB port can be pluged before it fails. The final result will be shown on the computer screen. The testing video is shown below:

##### **Camera Platform With Two Degrees of Freedom**

I used two servos to move the vision field of the camera both vertically and horizontally. Video:

##### **Johnny-five Project**

I used an 8x8 LED Matrix to show the words “I love Roboterra” in both scroll display and static display. Video:

##### **Airplane Model Project**
This project is relativly simple compared with other project. I build an airplane model which does not have a micro-controller on it.

#### **1.2 Others:** 
##### **Teaching Tasks**
I acted as a teaching assistant for one class and spent 5 days with the only two kids in the class and taught them how to build a robot. I also evaluated the IDE RoboRocks and came up with some new Methods to show to those kids. 

##### **EE Engineer Tasks**
I learned the usage of cosmos and triode during this intern. I designed a LED circuit controlled by a cosmos, trying to solve the interfere problem between LED and sound sensor. 

I also tried to fix the burned Pixy camera. However, I failed. 

### **2. What's Best**

I really love the environment of RoboTerra office, every co-worker is skillful, nice and willing to help. Whenever I had problems, I can always find someone to ask. And in my opinion, this is the quality that a top company should have. 

Besides the best environment, I also appreciate that the working time is from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. which helps me to avoid traffic rush. And since I live in Minhang, I cannot imagine what it would be like if I need to get to office before 8 a.m. 

There are plenty of materials in the office so when we have an idea we can quickly put our idea into practice, which is a great advantage since we do need lots of materials while working on a project. 

### **3. Things Need to Be Improved**

Material management needs to be improved. All the materials and screws being placed in a shelf indeed provided us great convinence. But I still think important things such as RoboCore, Arduino, Servos and Sensors should be marked with a number for an efficient management. And those broken broads and servos should be marked out clearly so that no one will use them before they are repaired. 

There is no delicious food around SHTC, which is a great problem. I even started to miss my school cafteria when I started my intern at SHTC. But this is not a easy problem to solve anyway.

### **4. Things I Want To Do In The Future**

Since I have been admitted by Umich, I will go on with the Dual degree program. I would like to take jobs that are related to IOT devices or machine learning. So I would apply for Stanford or MIT for my graduate education.
